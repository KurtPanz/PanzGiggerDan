Local music / musicians are rising at a vast rate. This means giggs has to be managed for musicians, bands, singers ,Dj's and any music related artist. Many singers or musicians are keeping their giggs or event dates in a diary or either on a memo pad on the phone. After years of doing giggs or events all these may build up and be untidy. Singers might also forget their diary at a event and their lyrics will be lost.

There is a variety of problems when managing giggs, but with PanzGiggerDan all these problems are managed with experiences from past musicians.
